2D action game
* dark (lovecraftian?) dungeons
  * black background
    * only some night sky at intro, when player falls into the pit
  * sometimes glow - mushrooms, torches (pulsating!), lamps, lava, moonlight
  * labirinthine
* giant sneks
  * snek eat you
  * sneks are portals
    * first snake is unavoidable, others should be seeked out by the player to progress?
      * NO, seeking out is too hard a thing
      * or, if you don't defeat snek, it will eat you again and reset the level
        * levels should be TINY then
* multigenre!
* player is fighter with comboes
  * combos on pistol. what?
    * comb with movement and melee
    * combos might make pistol into something completely different, like shooting boomerang
  * player is a blob, which can combine stuff?
  * player is combine harvester! mini-game with harvesting grass to regen or something
* bullet-hell enemies (stationary things and bosses)
  * snek flies through level, damaging player and/or firing bullets in patterns
* blob enemies who crowd, low damage
  * if left unchecked and can't reach player will combine into bigger more advanced blob-thing
    * special attacks, just as much HP, etc
* ghosts who crowd torches/lamps
  * crowded lamp slowly dims and goes out
  * when all lamps go out, ghosts immediatly eat player
  * incorporeal - fly through walls

Graphics
* level is just white sillhoutte (tile sprites)
* player is same, but sillhoutte moves (when player does something and sometimes at random)
  * like in "build a better buddy" by cart
