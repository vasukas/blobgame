Also just notes

how to read this todo:
- feature not yet done
    - sub-feature (part of the parent feature)
+ completed feature (group of features is considered completed only when all sub-features are)
? not sure this feature is needed or important
- features are listed in order of importance, more or less

General reminder
- I have no idea what I'm doing, for the most part
- Code quality. Doesn't. Matter. At. All.
    - as long as it mostly works and doesn't crash the game for no reason
        - silent errors are better than panicking :)


Important bugs
==============
+ ESC/F10/F3 buttons might not work in browsers! they're used by browsers themselves
- switching to fullscreen SOMETIMES doesn't work on itch.io with Firefox
- playtest fucking EVERYTHING
+ add LICENSE file and list used assets, with source and license
- DONT FORGET TO GREP AND FIX ALL TODOS
- (sometimes) bevy_kira_audio::audio_output: Failed to set volume for instance: CommandQueueFul
- sometimes player seems to be hit by projectiles but isn't damaged
- sometimes screen is black - egui actually draws windows in random order!
...


Needs to be done ASAP
=====================
- mechanics (minimal)
    + walls and player movement
        + spawn
        + simple kinematic controller
    + turret enemy
        + rotating turret
        + health
        + projectiles (ALL attacks in game are projectiles, techically)
        + respawn
    - player
        + dash
            - dash to cursor, to the exact point if it's in range
        - fire
            + ray: hits first target
            - fix ray
                - damage applied multiple times (and effect spawned multiple times too)
                - at least visually hit point often is invalid
            - hitting projectile will destroy it
            - hitting Volatile projectile will explode it
            - during dash makes x2 damage if shot goes in 90 arc in dash direction
            ? if button held, makes charged shot, which will fire a projectile when released
        - punch
            - hitting volatile projectile will make it do x2 damage and fly x2 faster
                - also if it enemy's, makes it player's and deflects it to cursor
            - during dash applied to whole trajectory, not just in front of player
            ? does x2 damage if executed immediatly after dash (and x4 damage to punched projectile instead of x2)
    - spawn waves
    - asteroids (just big rocks, what else is there?)
        - would be fun to split them in parts on hit
    - healing? drops and from some enemies?

- mechanics (intermediate)
    - interface etc
        - HUD
        - player reaction to being hit - particles, pulsating color, shaking, changing color, HUD, sound, etc
        - tutorial messages (and tutorial wave)
    - craft
        - enemies drop parts: (group 1: sphere, ray; group 2: laser, magnet)
        - parts can be combined, replacing current mega-weapon
        - mega-weapons have limited uses and can't be stored
        - weapons
            - rocket (sphere + laser)
                - just projectile
            - shield (sphere + magnet)
                - when equipped, appears in front of the player
                - absorbs projectiles
                - deflects rays (still gets damaged, but less)
            - railgun (ray + laser)
                - just powerful ray which goes through all targets
            - deflector (ray + magnet)
                - pushes all projectiles away (and turns them into player's)
    - advanced enemies
        - turret patterns
        - mini-bosses (like shield robot)
        - movement
            - patterns
            - player-based
            ? collision avoidance
        ? statistics

- mechanics (advanced)
    - bosses
    ? maybe add shop? points are from asters
    ? combining smaller enemies into bigger ones
    ? add gamepad/touch support

- graphics
    + explosions
    - particles
        + hit sparks
        - dust from asters
    - animated rays

- audio
    - play beats, controlled by level via state:
        0 (no beats)
        1 |       |
        2 |   i   |   i  
        3 | . i . | . i .
            feel free to use other patterns, but you get the idea
            also mb 3rd level would be too much, dunno
        - beat timing should be adjustable (store them in resource)
        - provide resource with timings - when beat will begin and how long till next one
            // something like this - this is resource
            struct BeatTimings {
                next: Duration, // actually timestamp, not duration, based on GameTime::now()
                period: Duration, // time between closest beats
                level: u8, // or use separate struct/resource for it, doesn't matter
            }
        ? use two sets of beats - for when player is having good damage and for when player is low on HP

    - play ambient drone (tbh really not sure if this will work; maybe just use some music)
        - some system should control what to play; for now just change it over time
        - idea is there would be several drones of different tones, which could warn the player about
            being low on HP, boss appearing, etc

    + sound playback
        - features
            - positional sound (not all sounds are positional)
                + has fixed position
                ? follows specified entity
                + panning and volume change depending on distance and direction relatively to player
                - fix panning
                ? startup delay depending on distance
                ? doppler effect, but not sure if it would be even heard
            + slightly randomized parameters - volume, speed, panning
            ? delay before start
        + event (just play sound once)
        ? loop (play looped sound when component is added to the entity; removal doesn't matter for now)
            - sound pitch should be controlled, probably via same component

    - actual sounds
        - some can be taken from here: https://github.com/vasukas/rodent/tree/binary_sounds/data/sounds
            don't forget to convert them for kira
        - actual list will be ready later

    ? would be nice to have volume limiter to avoid peaking, but that may be non-doable

...


Additional features
===================
? more mechanics
...



Would be nice to have but not important
=======================================
- settings
    - remappable controls (just make UI for InputMap)
    - play sound when adjusting volume - when user stops moving slider
- player cursor / laser sight - to indicate where shots will go
? gamepad and touch support - probably will be unplayable


Only after jam
==============
- refactor, comment, playtest
- try using leafwing-input-manager
- co-op - possibly even over network; would require adjusting difficulty
- is bevy_web_resizer still required or is that issue already fixed?
