Also just notes

how to read this todo:
- feature not yet done
    - sub-feature (part of the parent feature)
+ completed feature (group of features is considered completed only when all sub-features are)
? not sure this feature is needed or important
- features are listed in order of importance, more or less

General reminder
- I have no idea what I'm doing, for the most part
- Code quality. Doesn't. Matter. At. All.
    - as long as it mostly works and doesn't crash the game for no reason
        - silent errors are better than panicking :)
- ALL WORLD (POSITIONAL) SOUNDS MUST BE PREFIXED with 250ms SILENCE !!!


Important bugs
==============
- DONT FORGET TO GREP AND FIX ALL TODOS
- playtest everything
...


Needs to be done ASAP
=====================

- immediate
    - add player and item models (grep "blob")
    - movement trail
    - boss with rays and rockets
    - guided rockets
    - sounds: ui_weapon_broken

- add description on itch
- more compact tutorial text

- would be nice
    - gameplay
        - shield (sphere & magnet)
            - when equipped, appears in front of the player
            - absorbs projectiles
            - deflects rays (still gets damaged, but less)
            - sound
        - mini-bosses (like shield robot)
        - enemies
            - bosses (just stuff moving in patterns)
            - more wave patterns

- later only if there is time
    - deflector (ray & magnet)
        - pushes all projectiles away (and turns them into player's)
        - sound
    - bonk projectiles in cursor direction

...


Additional features
===================
- coherent code
- weapon and part icons (for menu)
- timing on beats (sound) might be wrong?
- fix plasma balls being self-destroyed on contact with small projectiles
- expand healing mechanics
- asteroids, maybe, lol

? more mechanics

+ mechanics (minimal)
    + walls and player movement
        + spawn
        + simple kinematic controller
    + turret enemy
        + rotating turret
        + health
        + projectiles (ALL attacks in game are projectiles, techically)
        + respawn
    + player
        + dash
            + dash to cursor, to the exact point if it's in range
        + fire
            + ray: hits first target
            + fix ray
                + damage applied multiple times (and effect spawned multiple times too)
                + hit point is invalid if origin.x < 0 ??? (invalid angle math)
            + hitting projectile will destroy it
    + spawn waves
    + healing loot

- mechanics (intermediate)
    - craft
        + enemies drop parts: (group 1: sphere, ray; group 2: laser, magnet)
        + parts can be combined, replacing current mega-weapon
        + 1st group of weapons (player can keep only two at once; have limited uses)
            + rocket (sphere & laser)
                + just projectile
            + railgun (ray & laser)
                + just powerful ray which goes through all targets
                + explodes projectiles
        + notify player when weapon breaks
    + interface etc
        + HUD
        + player reaction to being hit - [x]particles, [x]pulsating color, shaking, changing color, HUD, [x]sound, etc
        + player hit sound
        + animate background grid
    + simple statistics (point counting)
    + ubercharge beats
    + combo-attacks & show them in world
        + gun/dash combo
    - advanced enemies
        - movement
            - patterns
            - player-based

- delayed features
    - player
        - fire
            - hitting Volatile projectile will explode it
            - during dash makes x2 damage if shot goes in 90 arc in dash direction
            ? if button held, makes charged shot, which will fire a projectile when released
        - punch
            - hitting volatile projectile will make it do x2 damage and fly x2 faster
                - also if it enemy's, makes it player's and deflects it to cursor
            - during dash applied to whole trajectory, not just in front of player
            ? does x2 damage if executed immediatly after dash (and x4 damage to punched projectile instead of x2)
    - advanced enemies
        - collision avoidance
    - asteroids (just big rocks, what else is there?)
        - would be fun to split them in parts on hit

- mechanics (advanced)
    ? maybe add shop? points are from asters
    ? combining smaller enemies into bigger ones
    ? add gamepad/touch support

+ graphics
    + explosions
    + particles
        + hit sparks
    + animated rays
    + world text

- audio
    + play beats (ubercharge)
        + sync to floor grid
        ? use two sets of beats - for when player is having good damage and for when player is low on HP
    + startup delay for positional sounds, depends on distance

    - play ambient drone (tbh really not sure if this will work; maybe just use some music)
        - some system should control what to play; for now just change it over time
        - idea is there would be several drones of different tones, which could warn the player about
            being low on HP, boss appearing, etc

    + sound playback
        + features
            + positional sound (not all sounds are positional)
                + has fixed position
                + panning and volume change depending on distance and direction relatively to player
                + fix panning
            + slightly randomized parameters - volume, speed, panning
        + event (just play sound once)
    ? advanced sound playback
        - positional sound
            - follows specified entity
            - doppler effect, but not sure if it would be even heard
        - loop (play looped sound when component is added to the entity; removal doesn't matter for now)
            - sound pitch should be controlled, probably via same component

    ? would be nice to have volume limiter to avoid peaking, but that may be non-doable

+ UX
    + add lore
        + rename the projectile
        + change various texts
    + tutorial messages (and tutorial wave)
    + add difficulty selection (scale HP and loot drop chance)

...


Important bugs (old)
==============
- really important
    - sometimes screen is black - egui actually draws windows in random order??
        + fixed (except for main menu, which seems to work correctly anyway)
        - not thoroughly tested
- don't care for know
    - switching to fullscreen SOMETIMES doesn't work on itch.io with Firefox
    - (sometimes) bevy_kira_audio::audio_output: Failed to set volume for instance: CommandQueueFul
    - (seems fixed) sometimes player seems to be hit by projectiles but isn't damaged
+ ESC/F10/F3 buttons might not work in browsers! they're used by browsers themselves
+ add LICENSE file and list used assets, with source and license



Would be nice to have but not important
=======================================
- settings
    - remappable controls (just make UI for InputMap)
    - play sound when adjusting volume - when user stops moving slider
- player cursor / laser sight - to indicate where shots will go
- reduce amount of exclusive systems
? gamepad and touch support - probably will be unplayable


Only after jam
==============
- refactor, comment, playtest
- try using leafwing-input-manager
- co-op - possibly even over network; would require adjusting difficulty
- is bevy_web_resizer still required or is that issue already fixed?
